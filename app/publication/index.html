                    Penalty for the Good Corporation: what will happen to Google and others for violating the GDPR

                <p class="main-text-desc">
                    On January 21, the French National Data Protection Commission (CNIL) announced on its website that it had fined Google
                    for violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It took six months for the EU countries to make a
                    quality level-up in the amount of fines for non-compliance with this standard. Prior to that, the fine was mainly €
                    20,000-30,000, with the largest fine amounting to € 400,000 and related to a hospital in Portugal. But this precedent is
                    interesting not so much the amount of the fine as the rigidity of the regulator's approaches. Denis Beregovyi, Axon
                    Partners, explains why, especially for Mind.
                    For what? The group complaints against Google arrived at CNIL on the same day that the GDPR came into force. The
                    complainants reported that Google processed users' personal data without due cause, in particular to create personalized
                    advertising offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <span class="main-text">
                        To the attention of Ukrainian security officers: the inspection was conducted online, without searches, without seizure
                        of servers or other visible interference for business. And so it was possible.
                    </span>
                </h2>
                <h2 class="main-price-2">
                    According to the results of CNIL inspections revealed violations of two requirements of the GDPR:
                </h2>
                <p><span class="span">1.</span>Transparency and awareness of users about the processing of personal data.</p>
                <p><span class="span">2.</span>Lack of proper user consent for the processing of personal data for the purpose of personalizing advertising.</p>
                <p>
                    In the case of personalization of advertising, Google was sure to obtain the consent of users, because, firstly, when
                    creating Google accounts, the user agrees to the Privacy Policy, and secondly, Google has a section "Ads
                    personalization", where you can disable this feature.
                </p>
                <img class="img-illustration" src="img/Illustration.jpg" alt="Illustration">
                <p class="p-desc">This is what the ad personalization settings window in your Google Account looks like</p>
                <p>
                    However, CNIL does not think so, because the information about the personalization of advertising is not clear enough to
                    users. As an example, the Commission claims that the relevant "Personalization" window does not contain information on
                    the full range of Google services that collect and process personal data for this purpose (YouTube, Google search, Play
                    Store, Google pictures, Gmail, etc.).), and therefore, the user cannot realize to what extent the data is used and how
                    exactly they can be combined.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-price-2">
                    So, let's walk through the text of the CNIL decision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why France and not Ireland. Google operates in Europe through a legal entity in Ireland. But the case was not initiated
                    by the Irish, but by the French regulator. This is why it happened.

                    If data processing decisions are taken anywhere outside the EU, there is a one-stop mechanism - where the complaint is
                    received, the body considers it. Because Google's data processing center is located in the United States and the
                    complaint was first received in France, CNIL considered it.
